    - üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Jan and I am a passionate software developer with a mathematical background. In the past I have worked with a wide variety of technologies, but now have a focus on backend development in Python.
    - I am currently particularly interested in topics such as software architecture, Domain Driven Design and Machine Learning and am a big fan of Test Driven Development (TDD).
    - I also worked as an agile coach and as an interim product owner for a while, which often helps me to think across roles and adopt non-technical perspectives.
