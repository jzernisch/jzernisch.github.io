    - üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm Jan, passionate full stack web developer with focus on Python, Ruby and React. I have experience with larger event-based microservice architectures as well as with monolithic frameworks like Django or Ruby on Rails.
    - In addition to software design and architecture, I am also interested in agile methods and have also worked as an agile coach for some time, which helps me to think across roles and to build bridges in many areas. High quality is very important to me, which includes not only good design but also testing, which is why I like developing test-driven (TDD).
