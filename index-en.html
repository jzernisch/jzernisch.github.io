about_section:
    - heading: Software Development
      text: My focus is on the backend development of web applications with Ruby and Python. Sustainable quality is important to me, and I rely on concepts such as TDD, SOLID and hexagonal architecture. Cooperation with domain experts is of course essential, and I find Domain Driven Design particularly helpful in this regard.
    - heading: Agile Coaching
      text: I support organizations to become more "agile". I have an ideology-free, pragmatic view of agility and my operational background helps me to understand the challenges of complex domains such as product development and to address them appropriately.
